Project Overview
Elections play a crucial role in democratic governance, yet traditional voting systems face numerous challenges, including security vulnerabilities, lack of transparency, and potential vote manipulation. These issues can lead to tampered votes, inaccurate counting, and decreased public trust in the electoral process. To address these concerns, our project introduces a Blockchain-Based Voting System that leverages blockchain technology to ensure a transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof voting mechanism.
The primary goal of this project is to enhance election security and transparency by enabling voters to securely cast their votes through blockchain technology stored on the Ethereum blockchain. By implementing smart contracts, the system ensures fair and impartial voting, preventing duplicate or altered votes. Each vote is securely recorded in an immutable blockchain ledger, reducing the risks of fraud and unauthorized vote modifications. This system strengthens public confidence in elections by eliminating vulnerabilities associated with traditional methods.
Additionally, the project incorporates MetaMask, a browser wallet extension, to authenticate users and facilitate secure voting transactions. By eliminating centralized voter databases and third-party intermediaries, the blockchain-based approach enhances election security, accessibility, and trustworthiness. This innovation contributes to the modernization of democratic processes, ensuring fair and fraud-resistant elections.

Development Tools
Back-end Development
•	Solidity – Utilized for smart contract development, ensuring secure and transparent management of voter registration, vote casting, and result tabulation.
•	ERC-20 Standard – Implemented for voting tokens, enabling seamless and standardized transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) – Used for securely storing election-related data, such as election results, voter receipts, and candidate information.
Front-end Development
•	HTML & CSS – Used to structure and style the user interface, ensuring a simple yet functional design for voter interaction.
•	Ethers.js – Facilitates interaction between the front-end and Ethereum blockchain, enabling smooth communication with smart contracts.
•	(Previously Considered: AngularJS & Angular Material) – Initially planned for use but later replaced with HTML & CSS due to compatibility issues with Remix IDE.
dApp Deployment
•	Blockchain Network – The decentralized application (dApp) is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing its decentralized structure for secure and verifiable voting transactions.
•	MetaMask – Serves as the authentication gateway for voters, allowing them to securely interact with the blockchain and cast their votes through their browser wallets.
