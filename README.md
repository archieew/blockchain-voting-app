🗳️ Project Overview
Elections are fundamental to democratic governance, yet traditional voting systems often face challenges such as security vulnerabilities, lack of transparency, and the risk of vote manipulation. These issues can lead to tampered ballots, inaccurate vote counts, and decreased public trust in electoral processes.

To address these concerns, our project introduces a Blockchain-Based Voting System that leverages the Ethereum blockchain to provide a transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof voting mechanism. The primary goal of this project is to enhance election security and transparency by allowing voters to securely cast their votes using blockchain technology.

Through the use of smart contracts, the system ensures fair and impartial elections by preventing duplicate or altered votes. Every vote is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, reducing the risks of fraud and unauthorized modifications. This approach strengthens public confidence by eliminating many of the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional voting methods.

The project also integrates MetaMask, a browser wallet extension, to authenticate voters and facilitate secure, blockchain-based transactions. By removing centralized databases and third-party intermediaries, our blockchain solution enhances election integrity, accessibility, and trustworthiness. This innovation contributes to the modernization of democratic systems, ensuring fair and fraud-resistant elections.

🛠️ Development Tools
🔧 Back-End Development
Solidity – Used for developing smart contracts that manage voter registration, vote casting, and result tabulation securely and transparently.

ERC-20 Standard – Implemented to create voting tokens, ensuring seamless and standardized transactions on the Ethereum network.

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) – Utilized to store election-related data securely, including results, voter receipts, and candidate profiles.

🎨 Front-End Development
HTML & CSS – Used to build a clean, functional, and user-friendly interface for voters.

Ethers.js – Enables smooth interaction between the front-end and the Ethereum blockchain by connecting with deployed smart contracts.

(Previously Considered: AngularJS & Angular Material) – Initially planned for the front-end but replaced due to compatibility issues with the Remix IDE.

🌐 dApp Deployment
Ethereum Blockchain – The decentralized application (dApp) is deployed on Ethereum, utilizing its distributed ledger for secure and verifiable voting processes.

MetaMask – Acts as the user authentication gateway, allowing voters to securely log in and cast votes directly from their browser wallet.
